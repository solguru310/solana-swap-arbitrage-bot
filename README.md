# Solana Swap Arbitrage Bot

A Solana arbitrage bot leverages price differences between Raydium's AMM and centralized exchanges using the CCXT library. 

## Overview

A Solana arbitrage bot is designed to exploit price differences between Raydium's Automated Market Maker (AMM) on the Solana blockchain and centralized exchanges (CEX) via the CCXT library. 
The bot continuously monitors token prices on Raydium Swap, executing profitable trades by buying tokens at a lower price on one platform and selling them at a higher price on the other, ensuring quick and efficient transactions through Solana's high-speed network. 
This strategy takes advantage of real-time price discrepancies and low transaction fees to optimize gains across decentralized and centralized exchanges.
